            This is the Information Technology age and at its core is Computer
            Science. The study of computer science is therefore critical if
            society is to take full advantage of the benefits Information
            Technology has to offer and make rapid economic advances. Computer
            science involves the study and development of applications that
            allow for our everyday use of computers, the software systems that
            support these applications, and the means and methods used to
            produce both applications and systems that behave reliably,
            correctly and ethically. At the heart of Computer Science lies the
            skill of computer programming and employers who hire Computer
            Scientists expect adept programmers with knowledge of current
            techniques and tools and the ability to apply sound engineering
            principles to the development, construction and maintenance of
            computer programs. The range of courses available in the department
            and the skills acquired by students enable them to find employment
            in many diverse fields of the economy and prepare our graduates for
            the computing industry, working in a project team (or research and
            development team), and to enable the graduate to bring specialist
            skills to that team. The course also provides the platform for
            further study or research through exposure to established and
            emerging technologies and methods, and to active fields of research
            in Computer Science. The Department offers two undergraduate degree
            programmes, Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Single-Major
            (3:2:1:1) and Major-Minor (3:2:2:1) as well as Bachelor of Science
            in Information Technology.

          <strong>Organization</strong>
          <br />
          The University of Ghana is one of the Africa's most preminent public
          universities. Our impact on individuals, our region and the world is
          profound, whether we are launching young people into a boundless
          future or confronting the grand challenges of our time through
          dauntless research. UG educates more than 38,000students annually,
          with approximately 2.64% being computer science students. We turn
          ideas into impact and transform the world around us. For more about
          our impact, visit our news site, UG News.
